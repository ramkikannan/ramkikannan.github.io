Generally, people know me as Ramki. I am the Group leader for Discrete Algorithms in Oak Ridge National Laboratory focusing on large scale data mining, machine learning and graph algorithms on HPC systems and modern architectures with applications from scientific domain and many different internet services. I received my Ph.D in Computer Science from College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology(GaTech) advised by Prof. Haesun Park. Prior to Ph.D., worked on Data Analytics group at IBM TJ Watson Research Center and was an IBM Master Inventor. Under the advise of Prof. Narahari, graduated from Indian Institute of Science with M.Sc (Engg). 

## Research Interests 

* Scalable Data mining, Machine learning and Graph Algorithms on HPC systems and big data architectures
* Linear and Non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithms such as Matrix & tensor factorization, autoencoders, factor models and Low Rank Approximation
* Principal investigator for [Parallel Low Rank Approximation with Non-negative Constraints (PLANC)](https://ramkikannan.github.io/planc-api)
